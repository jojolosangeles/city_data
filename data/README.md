### Folder Structure
 
##### "real" folder

The data/real folder is included in .gitignore

This folder should be manually populated for local testing with real city data.

##### "sample" folder

The data/sample folder uses the same name as the real CSV data file,
but has a small number of rows.

----
Sample data files:

- Traffic_Collision_Data_from_2010_to_Present.csv from https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Traffic-Collision-Data-from-2010-to-Present/d5tf-ez2w
includes a single "Northeast" LA record (for filter testing)
